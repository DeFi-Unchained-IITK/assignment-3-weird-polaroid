For Task 2-
This Solidity smart contract seeks to establish a straightforward yet efficient and practical voting approach that is controlled by a manager. The deployer of the contract who is also the admin can only add candidates and register voters. The record of candidates and voters is kept in this contract within structured mappings where each voter has a registration status as well as voting status for each candidate which are identified by their unique id’s. This way, the administrators can easily add candidates by name and voters by their addresses thus assuring that one voter does not vote twice or more before being registered. Any registered voter can cast his vote for any candidate simply by inputting his/her name correctly, so that there will be no double-voting from the same individual, and it will ensure that correct ID’s of selected persons are given to the system. Voting increases the number of votes casted by an individual; for instance, a particular person cannot vote anymore if he/she has already voted at least once for another candidate. Here we have functions which can be used to count all votes obtained by any candidate as well as define who won depending on whose score was higher among all others. Thus, it allows transparently secure voting system monitored closely through the admin with specific controls that block all unauthorized actions which may result in biased voting outcomes. Next are test functions for Solidity to ensure that the Smart Voting Contract functions correctly and is integrity-bound. The "VotingTest" contract is built on the Forge framework with test cases that validate central features of the voting system. The setUp function sets up a new instance of the Voting contract before each test. "TestAdmin" ensures that setting the deployer of the contract to an admin is correct. "TestAddCandidate" creates a candidate adding function, testing for correctly stored candidate ID, name, and initial vote count. "TestRegisterVoter" ensures a voter can register without any problem and test for the status of voter registration and voting. The "testVote" function tests the voting process by first adding a candidate and then registering a voter; it checks to see that the voter's vote was appropriately tallied and that his or her status as a voter changed. The "testGetVoteCount" function makes sure that a vote count for a candidate is returned correctly after voting. The "testGetWinner" function finally checks that the system correctly identifies and returns the name of the candidate with the highest votes. All these extensive testing suites are quite important for making a case for a solid and reliable voting contract that behaves according to expectations in different scenarios.
